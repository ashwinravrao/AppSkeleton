### AppSkeleton
App skeleton built using standard Android libraries and patterns...

- Local data source consists of a Room instance returning LiveData-wrapped objects
- MVVM for scalability and Data Binding for convenience
- Uses AndroidX libraries
- Dependencies are injected manually, but more complex projects may benefit from a framework
