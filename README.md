### AppSkeleton
App skeleton for future projects built using standard Android architecture libraries and patterns...

- Local data source consists of a Room instance that returns LiveData-wrapped objects via a singleton Repository
- MVVM for scalability and Data Binding for convenience
- AndroidX migration
- Dependencies are injected manually, but a framework should probably be used as the project grows
