### AppSkeleton
Example app built using ...

- Room database returning LiveData-wrapped collections via repository pattern
- MVVM for scalability and Data Binding for convenience
- AndroidX libraries
- Manual dependency injection but frameworks could benefit larger projects

This is the bare skeleton of an app, built using the most up-to-date first-party libraries
