### AppSkeleton
App skeleton built from scratch using standard Android libraries and patterns...

- Local data source consists of a Room instance that returns LiveData-wrapped objects via a singleton Repository
- MVVM for scalability and Data Binding for convenience
- Using Android extension libraries (AndroidX)
- Dependencies are injected manually, but a framework may be helpful as the project grows
