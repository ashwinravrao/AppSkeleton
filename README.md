### AppSkeleton
App skeleton built using standard Android libraries and patterns...

- Local data source consists of a Room instance returning LiveData-wrapped objects
- MVVM for scalability and Data Binding for convenience
- Uses AndroidX libraries
- Dependencies are injected manually, but more complex projects may benefit from a framework

This is a portion of an app. The skeleton, if you will, meant to serve as the foundation for a more complex app. I'm writing this project partly as a personal desk reference and partly for anyone who finds it and finds it useful.
